#### BookmarksBase is a tool that allows you to search within your bookmarks including entire contents of web sites, addresses and titles. ####

----------

# 1. Instructions for the user #

In application package you get:

- `BookmarksBase.Importer` &mdash; **First run this tool** to generate database of bookmarks along with their contents. It produces `bookmarksbase.xml` file. If everything works fine, it will print long list of addresses followed by: 

> bookmarksbase.xml file saved

- `BookmarksBase.Search.exe` &mdash; **Main application intended for searching.** It basically searches within `bookmarksbase.xml` generated by the importer.
- `BookmarksBase.Search.dll` &mdash; Library file containing implementation of search.
- `lynx` folder &mdash; Files of Lynx browser used for HTML parsing required by the importer.
- `x64` and `x86` folders &mdash; Folders with runtime libraries required by the importer.
- `System.Data.SQLite.dll` &mdash; Runtime library required by the importer.

- You can use TAB to switch between search box and results list
- You can move up and down using keyboard when results list is focused
- Search is case insentive and a text you enter is compiled as a regular expression
- If you wish to express any number of any characters use `.*`
